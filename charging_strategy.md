#  Car Charging Strategy with 360-Degree Radar

## Overview
This document outlines a strategic approach for the IEEE competition, where cars are powered by super capacitors and need to stop at charging stations around the track. The key to winning is either by being the last car still powered or by overtaking all other cars.

## Strategy
Our  car will implement a 360-degree radar system. This allows it to monitor the positions of other cars and strategically decide when to leave a charging station.

### Key Points
- **Charge Maximization**: Stay at a charging station until another car approaches to ensure the supercapacitor is fully charged.
- **Strategic Departure**: Leave the charging station just in time to maintain a lead, conserving energy for later stages of the race.
- **Energy Conservation**: Minimize unnecessary movement to conserve energy, only moving when needed to stay ahead or when a charging station is at risk of being occupied by another car.
- **Overtaking and Blocking**: Use the radar to detect and strategically position the car to block or overtake competitors.

### Implementation 
1. **Charge Maximization**: By staying at a charging station until another car is detected approaching, our  car can ensure its supercapacitor is as charged as possible before moving on.
2. **Strategic Movement**: Monitoring competitor positions allows for strategic movement, avoiding unnecessary energy consumption and optimizing overtaking opportunities.

2. **Strategic Departure**: The radar system would allow our car to detect when another car is approaching the station. we can program our car to leave just in time to maintain a lead, forcing the following car to wait for the next available charging station or to use more energy to overtake.

3. **Energy Conservation**: This strategy would conserve energy by reducing the time our car spends driving as compared to other cars, which may be moving continuously between stations.

4. **Overtaking and Blocking**: If our car is at a charging station and a following car is approaching, we can leave the station to force the pursuing car to either slow down or attempt to overtake. If our car has more energy (due to more charging time), it may be able to maintain its lead more effectively.

5. **Race Dynamics**: By monitoring the positions of other cars, our car could strategically position itself on the track to either block or slow down competitors, or to choose the optimal time to overtake them.

Here are a few considerations for this strategy:

- **Timing**: The radar system must accurately judge the time it will take for an approaching car to reach the station, as well as the time required for our car to reach the next station. This calculation must account for the charging time needed and the distance to the next station.

- **Power Management**: we'll need to carefully balance the charging time against the risk of being overtaken while stationary. There's a trade-off between staying charged and the possibility that multiple cars could arrive simultaneously, leaving our car with no choice but to leave or be overtaken.


- **Technical Reliability**: The radar system must be reliable and have a fail-safe in case of malfunction. If the radar fails to detect an approaching car, our car could be overtaken while stationary.


If implemented effectively, this strategy could give our  car a significant advantage, turning the race into not only a test of speed but also a game of strategy and efficiency.
